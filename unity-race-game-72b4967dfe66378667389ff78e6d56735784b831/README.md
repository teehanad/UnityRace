# Race Game
Implement a 3D environment using unity. The environment will be a children friendly game consisting of a 2D plane with a path. The user will be able to run around the plane as a
circular race. There is several objects that the user will try and avoid as part of the game. To coincide with this, we plan on adding features that will allow the user to duck, jump and dodge from left to right using left/right keys, up/down keys and space key. Aside from just developing this program with keyboard
functionality we will have to develop in such a way that the project is generic enough that it can be ported to many devices and controlled by a variety of controllers e.g. the Kinect controller.
